## Basic authentication for Windows Azure websites
Basic authentication for Windows Azure websites is a HTTP managed module that provides basic authentication for web applications hosted in Windows Azure websites. For more information please read this [blog post](http://www.devbridge.com/articles/basic-authentication-for-windows-azure-websites).

Basic authentication module has relation to two projects:
- Devbridge.BasicAuthentication project has the implementation for the basic authentication module.
- Devbridge.BasicAuthentication.Test is simple test website that can be used to test basic authentication.

###Configuration Settings
* `allowRedirects`: indicates whether redirects are allowed without authentication.
* `excludes`: allows to configure rules to exclude certain parts of application from authentication.

####Sample excludes
```
<!-- exclude POST requests to URLs starting with /home; other requests (GET to /home/index, POST to /account/login) should be authenticated -->
<add url="^/home(.*)" verb="post" />
<!-- exclude POST requests to all URLs; other requests (GET to /home/index, DELETE to /account/123) should be authenticated -->
<add url="" verb="post" />
<!-- exclude all requests to URLs starting with /allow; other requests should be authenticated -->
<add url="^/allow(.*)" verb="" />
<!-- exclude all requests to URLs starting with /home; rules specified below overwrite previous rules with the same url pattern.  -->
<add url="^/home(.*)" verb="" />
```
